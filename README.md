# Bowling Game

## How to Compile and Run Bowling Game Code
1. Clone the git bundle by running git clone PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BUNDLE -b master
2. After cloning the folder, open the command line and go to go to ~/git/bowling-game/src
3. Run the command javac *.java, followed by the command java Main

## Input
After compiling and running the main class successfully, the command line should prompt for an input. Entering **valid** input will process the bowling move and update the score. Each bowling move should be entered one at a time.

## Output
After inputting a bowling move, a table will be displayed in the command line with the scoreboard. The scoreboard is in markup table format so you can directly copy and paste it into a markup editor and visualize the scoreboard as a table.
